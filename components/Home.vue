                    Hello! My name is
                    <h1>Arik Dicks</h1>
                    I'm a full-stack developer from Coquitlam, BC.<br>

            My passion is for solving complex problems through crafting well-engineered programs.

            Every layer of the stack has something interesting to it. Each has it's own challenges and the associated toolkits have their own in's and out's.
            From low-level coding with C/C++ with it's challenging analytical problems involving algorithms and design patterns, to front end and its
            requirement of quickly picking up new tools and being creative, I enjoy it all.
